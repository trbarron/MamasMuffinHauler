# Tyler Barron's Barron Wasteland

Hey! This is my personal site.

This is written in Javascript using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), as a framework. It utilizes [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) as a framework.

Site is currently deployed using [Amazon Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)

## Local Development

This is just a React project bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

## Getting Started

This project heavily favors <b>yarn</b> over npm. 

So to set things up you need to run

```bash
yarn install
```
or just
```bash
yarn
```

Then to run the development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

and it should open at

> http://localhost:3000/
