                        <p>Super Smash Bros. Melee is a "beautiful accident" because of it's speed, balance and ability for self-expression. It came out before the internet so it hasn't had balance patches, DLC or visual updates. This mod was an attempt to give our college's competitive scene a unique skin for the game</p>

                        <p>There is a small slice of the world who is still into Super Smash Bros. Melee on the Nintendo Gamecube. Over time players have asked more and more of themselves to reach higher heights. One roadblock to this is the physical controller and it's inherent flaws. This project aims to solve some of those drawbacks</p>

                        <Photo
                            src={gameCubeController}
                            alt=""
                            caption="My Modded Gamecube Controllers"
                        />

                        <p>This started with someone who need it most, Hax$. He is a top 20 player known for his extreme speed at the game but this speed came at a cost -- his hands. After several surgeries to reconstruct his hands he had to start over. He designed an ergonomic keyboard style controller called the B0XX.</p>

                        <Photo
                            src={haxBoxx}

                            caption="Hax's custom controller, the B0XX"
                        />

                        <p className="w-screen"></p>

                        <Video

                        />


                        <p>Hax promised to sell these controllers but he was very slow to make it market. As a result I decided to build my own</p>

                        <Photo
                            src={boxxRender}
                            alt=""
                            caption="Controller Rendering"
                        />

                        <p className="w-screen"></p>
                        <Photo
                            src={boxxLayout}
                            alt=""
                            caption="Controller Layout"
                        />

                        <p>I linked a more detailed build process. The build itself took 20 hours, two hardware trips, five online orders and one burnt thumb. The code is based on SimpleController's, modified for my button layout and application. The only thing left is to get good with it</p>
